# Repository for "Increased Attention Towards Progress Information Near a Goal State"

- `task` contains Python code used to run the experiment and communicate with the eye-tracker. 
- `analysis` contains all code used to preprocess and analyze data from the task. 

NOTE: Due to the high-dimensional nature of eyetracking data, as well as space limitations on Github, only the post-processed data is provided. If you would like access to the raw .EDF, .ASC, .HDF5, or .PSYDAT data, please do not hesitate to contact us.
